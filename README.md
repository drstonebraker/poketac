### What is this project?

I wanted to learn javascript, HTML, and CSS by building not just a basic Tic-Tac-Toe, but a game with 8 different artificially intelligent opponents
of different difficulty levels.  

The result is this game wrapped in a pokemon theme, which was chosen in part for the assets freely available online, and in part due to he natural fit given the storyline of 8 'gym leaders'.
